# Querier Implementation Specification

## File Structure
The implementation uses several source files and libraries:
- **libcs50**: A library providing data structures (hashtable, counters, etc.).
- **common**: Contains utilities for handling directories and indexes.

## Core Components

### 1. **Main Control Flow**
- **`main` Function**:
  - Validates arguments using `validate_args`.
  - Loads the index from `indexFilename` into an `index_t` structure.
  - Processes each query line from `stdin` using `process_query`.

### 2. **Argument Validation**
- **`validate_args`**:
  - Ensures exactly two arguments are provided.
  - Confirms the ability to open and read from `pageDirectory` and `indexFilename`.

### 3. **Query Processing**
- **`process_query`**:
  - Parses and normalizes each query.
  - Handles logical groupings of terms via `and_sequence` and `or_sequence`.
  - Collects and sorts results based on their rank using `getSortedResults`.

### 4. **Search Operations**
- **`and_sequence`**:
  - Finds intersections of counters for terms connected by AND.
- **`or_sequence`**:
  - Combines results from `and_sequence` for terms connected by OR using `counters_union`.

### 5. **Utility Functions**
- **`counters_intersection` and `counters_union`**:
  - Implement the logical AND and OR operations on counters.
- **`get_url`**:
  - Retrieves the URL corresponding to a page ID from the directory.

### 6. **Result Handling**
- **`getSortedResults`**:
  - Converts counters to `searchResult_t` array.
  - Sorts results by rank and outputs them.

## Algorithms
- **Sorting Algorithm**: Uses `qsort` for sorting search results based on rank.
- **Search Algorithm**: Utilizes hash tables for indexing and counters for tallying occurrences.

## Error Handling
- Checks for null pointers after allocations.
- Verifies file operations (open, read, write) for success.
- Handles incorrect user inputs gracefully with informative error messages.

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient data structures (hashtables, counters) are used to minimize search and insertion times.
- Memory usage is monitored and minimized, with appropriate checks for memory allocation failures.

## Security Measures
- Assumes data from the index is well-formed; includes basic checks against malformed data.
- Ensures robustness against typical security risks such as buffer overflows by limiting input sizes and validating inputs.

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: For individual functions like `counters_union`, `counters_intersection`.
- **Integration Tests**: Covering full query processing flows.
- **Stress Tests**: With large data sets to ensure performance under load.

## Conclusion
The implementation of the Querier is designed to be robust, efficient, and secure, suitable for processing complex queries over large datasets typically found in a search engine environment.
